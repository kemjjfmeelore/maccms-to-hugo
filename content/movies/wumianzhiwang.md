Back in the mid 1900's Mexico was proud to have more world boxing champions in the small categories, than any other Country. Boxing was perhaps one of the few opportunities where a typical low income Mexican(75% of the population)could have success in life. Kids started boxing in their ghettos, a few of them made it to the Pro's and an even fewer amount got to be famous and earn good money from it. Those that got to the top soon found out that suddenly they had a great amount of people that surrounded them and helped them spend their money. But immersed in their new life styles they could never leave their origins and find a better future for them. This is what "Campeon sin Corona" tries to convey; a boxer that even when he has succeeded can not live up to his new status and prefers to be the same loser he was in his earlier years. There may not be in the Mexican Movies Industry a picture that better displays the way of thinking and acting of the vast majority of Mexicans of the 20th Century.
