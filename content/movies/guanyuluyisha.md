Luisa, a 40-year-old singer, and her companion Julien, a guitarist and composer, have had a group together for many years. One day, her father - whom she has not seen since she was a teenager - comes to see her after a concert. The encounter, during which he tells her he is seriously ill, unsettles Luisa. She begins to look differently at the life she leads.
