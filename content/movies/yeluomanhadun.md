Attorney Sean Cassey is called on by the New York District Attorney to try drug kingpin Jordon Washington, accused of murdering two cops and injuring a third, Sean's father. The publicity from the trial is a boom to Sean's career, but when Washington's lawyer, Sam Vigoda, makes accusations of police corruption that hit Sean too close to home, Sean is divided between justice, his career, and his family.
