At Los Alamos, New Mexico, the maximum-security "atomic city" of U.S. nuclear-weapons research, top atomic scientist Frank Addison has a normal, middle-American life with his wife and son...until the boy is kidnapped by enemy agents to extort H-bomb secrets. Result, a fast moving chase thriller with some parental soul-searching.
