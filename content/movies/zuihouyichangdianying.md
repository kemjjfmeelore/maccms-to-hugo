Sid grew up with his mother Arabella in a cheerful and somewhat naïve Apulian community, which was filled with affection and a great passion for cinema. After years away he returns to the land of his childhood where his mother had created a cinematic arena and this trip in his childhood memories will lead to a better understanding of her human and existential aspects.
