The seminal question of land and the displacement of Adivasi (Indigenous) Communities in India. All the governments that have ruled the nation made laws that denied the indigenous people their way of life and their land often, protecting crony capitalist interests. It revisits an episode of dissent in the 90s which brought up this question amongst us. A history forgotten.
